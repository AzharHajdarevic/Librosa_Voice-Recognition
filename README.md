# Librosa_Voice-Recognition
A university data analysis project using Python and Jupyter Notebook, created in collaboration with fellow students. The project focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting insights from a dataset.

# University Project – Data Analysis in Python

## Project Description

This is a university project developed as part of our coursework, in collaboration with fellow students **Nedim Hamzić**, **Ines Fetahović**, and **Azhar Hajdarević**. The project focuses on practical data analysis using Python, aiming to apply theoretical knowledge acquired during our studies.

## Purpose

The main objective of this project was to load, clean, and analyze a dataset in order to extract meaningful insights. We used various data analysis and visualization techniques to explore patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These tools were used to process the data, handle missing values, visualize distributions, and summarize key metrics.

## Project Structure

The Jupyter Notebook contains the following key sections:

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**  
   Importing the dataset and preparing it for analysis by handling null values and formatting issues.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Using visualizations (histograms, bar charts, box plots, etc.) to understand data distributions and relationships between variables.

3. **Insights and Observations**  
   Drawing conclusions based on the analysis and identifying any noteworthy trends or patterns.
